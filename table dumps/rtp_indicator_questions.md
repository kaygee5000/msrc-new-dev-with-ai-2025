## OUTPUT INDICATORS

### School Teachers on the mobile app

The default should be that on creating an itinerary, all the questions should be prepopulated in
a checkbox style where the use should be able to deselect the ones he doesn’t like.

## OUTCOME ANALYSIS

1. The first indicator that we must analyze: “ **Total primary school enrolment (KG 1-**
    **Basic 6)** ”.
The thing with this indicator is that it is not being asked of the respondents. Right to play
wants to get this from the core mSRC system, but sergregated according the GALOP 13,
GALOP 3, Direct, etc.
2. The second is “ **Primary School dropout rate** ”.
3. The third is “ **Percentage of Schools with implementation plans** ”.

```
The formula for this is
!"#$%& () *+,((-* ./0, /#1-%#%2030/(2 1-32*
4(03- 2"#$%& () *+,((-* &%3+,%5 "25%& 	0 ,/* /0/2%&3&6^ 𝑥^100
```
```
The number of schools with implementation plan comes from the Consolidated
Checklist Outcome Questions Number 17, all the schools that answered YES.
```
4. The fourth indicator is “ **Percentage of schools that have school development plans**
    **that include LtP and/or holistic skills assessment** ”.

```
The formula for this is:
```
```
!"#$%& () *+,((-* 	0 , 30	 ,37% *+,((- 5%7%-(1#%20 1-32* 	0 , 30	 /2+-"5% 	809	 (& ,(-/*0/+ *:/--* 3**%**#%
4(03- 2"#$%& () *+,((-* &%3+,%5 𝑥^100
```
```
The numerator of the formula comes from the Consolidated Checklist Outcome
Question number 18, these are the people who actually uploaded the document, not
just those who said Yes. The upload is what confirms the numerator.
```
5. Fifth indicator is “Number of Schools reached” under that itinerary.

```
This will just be a number of schools visited by the district people under that itinerary.
```
6. The sixth indicator is “ **Percentage of total of district officials that score**
    **satisfactorily (70% or higher) on tests of knowledge and skills of coaching and**
    **mentoring on PBL (M/F)** ”.

```
For this indicator, just display the text, but don’t bother calculating anything.
```
7. The 7th indicator is “ **Percentage of teachers with lessons plans that include LtP** ”.

```
The formula for this is :
!"#$%& () 0%3+,%&*’ -%**(2 1-32* 3**%**%5 0( ,37% /2+-"5%5 	
4(03- 2"#$%& () 0%3+,%&*’ -%**(2 1-32* 3**%**%5 𝑋^100
```

```
The numerator of the formula comes from the Consolidated Checklist Outcome Question
number 1 9
```
8. The eight indicator is “ **Percentage learning environments that show evidence of**
    **LtP methods or manipulative** ”.

```
The formula is :
!"#$%& () -%**(2* 	0 , 30	 %2<3<% 8%3&2%&* /2 =,/-5 +%20%&%5 -%3&2/2<
4(03- 2"#$%& () -%**(2* ($*%&7%5 𝑋^100
```
```
The numerator of this comes from these three questions: 43 , 44 and 45 of the
Outcome Indicators, Partners in Play Questions. Each answer from these questions
correspond to a number which you will sum up, find the average and compare that
average to the overall and then find the number of people that scored above the
average you calculated.
Those who scored above is what becomes the numerator.
```

9. The tenth indicator is “ **Percentage of Teachers who have the skills to facilitate LtP**
    **in their learning environments with their children in accordance with the LtP**
    **Principles (M/F)** ”.

```
For this indicator, the formula is:
```
```
𝑁𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝑡𝑒𝑎𝑐ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑠 𝑜𝑏𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑑 𝑤ℎ𝑜 𝑑𝑒𝑚𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑑 𝐿𝑡𝑝 𝑠𝑘𝑖𝑙𝑙𝑠
𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑛𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝑡𝑒𝑎𝑐ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑠 𝑜𝑏𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑑
```
#### 𝑋 	

```
The numerator is gotten from ten questions. These are: 29 , 30 , 31 , 32 , 33 , 39 , 45 , 46 ,
48 and 49.
Each answer from these questions correspond to a number which you will sum up,
find the average and compare that average to the overall and then find the number of
people that scored above the average you calculated.
Those who scored above is what becomes the numerator.
