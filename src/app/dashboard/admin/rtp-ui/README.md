# RTP Dashboard UI Scaffold

This folder contains the UI scaffolding and mock data for the Right to Play (RTP) dashboard admin view. All components here are built using mock data and are intended for design approval before backend integration.

## Structure
- `components/`: React components for dashboard cards, filters, tables, etc.
- `mock/`: Mock data for indicators, filters, and submissions.
- `pages/`: Page-level components for the dashboard and indicator drill-downs.

## Next Steps
1. Build out the UI using mock data.
2. Get approval on the look, feel, and flow.
3. Replace mock data with live backend data and API integration.
