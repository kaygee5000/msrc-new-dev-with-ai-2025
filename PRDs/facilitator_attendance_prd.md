# ðŸ“„ Full PRD: Teacher Attendance, Punctuality, and Exercises Monitoring

## Purpose
To develop a comprehensive module within the MSRC Dashboard to track and analyze:
- **Weekly teacher attendance**
- **Teacher punctuality (days late)**
- **Lesson exercises given and marked (termly)**
- **Reasons for teacher absence**

This system will help GES officers at National, Regional, District, and Circuit levels easily monitor teacher engagement, attendance, and academic productivity, and make evidence-based decisions.

## KPIs to Track

| KPI | Description |
|:---|:---|
| Attendance Rate % | (Days Present / Expected Days) Ã— 100 |
| Punctuality Rate % | (Days on Time / Expected Days) Ã— 100 |
| Exercises Given | Termly total |
| Exercises Marked | Termly total |
| Exercise Marking Rate % | (Exercises Marked / Exercises Given) Ã— 100 |
| Absence Reasons | Summary table of absence breakdowns (Sick Leave, Maternity Leave, Official Duty, etc.) |

## Technology Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|:---|:---|
| Frontend | React + Next.js |
| UI Styling | TailwindCSS + MUI |
| Charts | ApexCharts |
| Backend | Laravel (existing MSRC backend) |
| Database | MySQL (teacher_attendance, teacher_exercises tables) |
| Authentication | Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) |

## Important Business Rules

- Teacher Codes must be **unique**.  
- Temporary Teachers must have codes starting with `"TMP-"`.
- Absence reasons must be selected if Days Present < Expected Days.
- "Released" teachers should be easily assignable back to any school.
- Weekly data = attendance + punctuality.
- Termly data = exercises given/marked.
